/**
 * Service implementation responsible for performing soft delete operations on
 * user accounts.
 *
 * <p>
 * This service removes users logically rather than physically deleting records
 * from the database.
 *
 * <p>
 * Soft delete behavior is typically implemented using Hibernate annotations
 * such as:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code @SQLDelete}</li>
 * <li>{@code @Where}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instead of removing the database row, the user record is marked as deleted
 * (for example: {@code isDeleted = true}), preserving historical and audit
 * data.
 *
 * <p>
 * This approach is useful for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Audit compliance</li>
 * <li>Data recovery</li>
 * <li>Maintaining relational integrity</li>
 * <li>Tracking user lifecycle history</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The delete operation is executed within a transactional boundary to ensure
 * consistency.
